<h1>MBAd6224: Decision Making and Data Analysis</h1>
<h2> Fall 2016, Denis F. Cioffi, Ph.D. </h2>

<a id="MBAd6224" class="anchor" href="#mbad6224" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>Introduction To This Page<font color="red">, a work in progress</font></h3>

 I have always enjoyed having a web page set up for my courses (e.g., <a href="http://267.cioffi.us">267.cioffi.us</a>).  In the four years since I last taught a full course, technology has continued to progress, but my old (very) website, <a href="http://www.cioffi.us">www.cioffi.us</a>, has not progressed.  Its current Google Drive home will not work at the end of August (and so the previous links may fail).  Before moving everything to GitHub (thanks, <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/" class="user-mention" target="_blank">Dr. Barba</a>!), I'm setting up this page for the course (and having fun doing it).  Initially, the page may just list some pdf LaTeX'ed files 'cause that's how I've been working, but more to come. (dfc 1 July 2015)

<h3> A Word About Learning  </h3>

<p>Twenty-five hundred years ago, Confucius understood learning:  <q>I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.</q>  You will succeed in this course first by working problems.  The computer will handle the mechanical calculations, but you will need to give meaning to the numbers output.  Most of us find statistical thinking and the language demanded non-intuitive.  The more you exercise statistical thinking and language, the more you will be able to think and speak statistically.  An analogy with lifting weights at the gym explains how many of us (yes, I was a student once) approach learning.  If I go to the gym and watch other people lift weights, do my muscles get stronger? It’s called <q>active learning</q> for a reason: just do it!</p>

<h3>The Ancient Concept Known as a Book</h3>
<p>While an isolated, static unit with a beginning, middle, and an end may still be useful as a conveyor of fiction, no book is assigned for this knowledge-based course. In our internet, open-source era, the transmission of information occurs through different specific media, but predominantly electronically. As much as I like books, I see no need for students to purchase a textbook when material you may wish to use to supplement the course’s video presentations is available at no cost, or in the case of the second item referenced below, for $2.99 (its free predecessor is also available on the web). Those students focused on Health Care should find that work especially worthwhile because of the author's background and his many examples from clinical trials (and its perspective is excellent). 
</p><p>
As a way to help us all, students and instructors, we will set up a reference page in Blackboard, across the entire course, where people can share particular resources they found helpful. As you can see immediately below, I have started the resources with three, well, for want of a better term, books. The first is the (somewhat costly) text on which the course was based originally, the second I noted above, and the third is the most modern version, an electronic, interactive, open-source compendium (from which chapters can be printed). It best represents the future of educational media. (dfc 16 July 2016)  </p>
