<a id="MBAd6224" class="anchor" href="#mbad6224" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>Introduction To This Page, <font color="blue"> Version 0.98</font></h3>

 I have always enjoyed having a web page set up for my courses (e.g., <a href="http://267.cioffi.us">267.cioffi.us</a>).  In the four years since I last taught a full course, technology has continued to progress, but my old (very) website, <a href="http:/www.cioffi.us">www.cioffi.us</a>, has not progressed.  Its current Google Drive home will not work at the end of August (and so the previous links may fail then).  Before moving everything to GitHub (thanks, <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/" class="user-mention" target="_blank">Dr. Barba</a>!), I'm setting up this page for the course (and having fun doing it).  Initially, the page may just list some pdf LaTeX'ed files 'cause that's how I've been working, but more to come. (dfc 1 July 2015)
 <p></p>     
        <ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
          <li> Structuring_224.pdf is no longer here, as expected.  But what needs to be added is, "Things You Should Know How to Do." Soon, I hope.</li>
          <p></p>
          <li> <a href="224_Video_Notes_1--14_melted.pdf" target="_blank">My notes on the in-depth videos</a>. I wrote these notes in June as I listened carefully to the hour-long "in-depth" lectures that Dr. Wirtz created. The amount of information in these videos, by the way, first gave me the idea that students would not need to buy a single (expensive) textbook, but could supplement that information by reading from the multiple sources available on the Internet. I make the notes available, however, to give modern students an idea of how to take notes.  When you look at the "Enjoy_Reading" file immediately below, you will find the first section is, "1.1 Teaching, Studying, and Learning," and it contains a link to, "The pen is mightier than the keyboard: Advantages of longhand over laptop note taking."
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByY6ydNOWOJaMHMyVk5tSmNoQzA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Enjoy_Reading.pdf</a>. (Material that I examined in preparing to teach the course.)  In two separate assignments, you will be asked to read two or more of the articles and write a couple of pages about them.  Details to come, soon.
          <ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
            <li>Many of the references above are recent, and a full statistical interpretation of scientific results involves more than we can cover in this course.  This year, a long-accepted "influential psychological theory, borne out in hundreds of experiments, may have just been debunked. How can so many scientists have been so wrong?" asked  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html" target="_blank"> Engber in Slate</a> magazine (2016).
            </li>
            <li>In response, Sanjay Srivastava, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon, created a  <a href="https://hardsci.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/everything-is-fucked-the-syllabus/" target="_blank">fictitious course</a>. Please do not be offended by the language, which is not my style, either (but I, and everyone to whom I have shown it, do find it funny; Dallal makes the same point, but without obscenity, in his book, below: "... meta-analysis is often deeply flawed").  Perhaps it is a reaction to the general pretentiousness of academe and an acknowledgment that we need knowledge and skepticism, both of which I hope you will find in this course. Most important, the papers are real, and one of them I had already chosen.
            </li>
            <li>The problem of "reproducibility" in computer science gives some insight into the more general problem to which the papers above refer.  <a href= "https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience-article/issues/5#issuecomment-241232791" target="_blank"> Here</a> my GW colleague Dr. Barba expresses her thoughts on the language in current discussions in computer science.
            </li>
            <li>One way we strive for good statistics is to make sure our samples are <a href="http://www.randomization.com" target="_blank"> truly random </a>.
            </li>
      </ol> <!-- couldn't prevent spacing here, so added it above -->
          <li> <a href="Synchronous_Sessions.html"> The Synchronous Sessions</a>. In addition to myself, the three individuals listed above will be guiding students through the material.  Each student will meet synchronously, with video, with about 14 colleagues and the Synchronous Session Leader for a total of ten hours this semester.
          </li>
      </ol>

<h3> A Word About Learning  </h3>

<p>Twenty-five hundred years ago, <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/education/12-famous-confucius-quotes-on-education-and-learning" target="_blank">Confucius understood learning</a>:  <q>I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.</q>  You will succeed in this course first by working problems.  The computer will handle the mechanical calculations, but you will need to give meaning to the numbers output.  Most of us find statistical thinking and the language demanded non-intuitive.  The more you exercise statistical thinking and language, the more you will be able to think and speak statistically.  An analogy with lifting weights at the gym explains how many of us (yes, I was a student once) approach learning.  If I go to the gym and watch other people lift weights, do my muscles get stronger? It’s called <q>active learning</q> for a reason: just do it!</p>

<h3>The Ancient Concept Known as a Book</h3>
<p>While an isolated, static unit with a beginning, middle, and an end may still be useful as a conveyor of fiction, no book is assigned for this knowledge-based course. In our internet, open-source era, the transmission of information occurs through different specific media, but predominantly electronically. As much as I like books, I see no need to force students to purchase a textbook when material to supplement the course’s video presentations is available at no cost, or in the case of the second item referenced below, for $2.99 (its free predecessor is also available on the web). Those students focused on Health Care should find that work especially worthwhile because of the author's background and his many examples from clinical trials (and its perspective is excellent). 
</p><p>
As a way to help us all, students and instructors, we will set up a reference page in Blackboard, across the entire course, where people can share particular resources they found helpful. As you can see immediately below, I have started the resources with three, well, for want of a better term, books. The first is the latest edition of the (somewhat costly) text on which the course was based originally, the second I noted above, and the third is the most modern version, an electronic, interactive, open-source compendium (from which chapters can be printed). It best represents the future of educational media, and I also recommend following David Lane on Twitter, at the <a href="https://twitter.com/LaneReport">Lane Report</a>. (dfc 20 July 2016)  </p>
