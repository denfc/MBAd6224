In the four years since I last taught a full course, technology has continued to progress, but my old (very) website, www.cioffi.us, has not progressed.  Its current Google Drive home will not work at the end of next month.  Before moving everything to GitHub (thanks, @labarba!), I'm setting up this page for the course (and having fun doing it).  Initially, the page may just list some pdf LaTeX'ed files 'cause that's how I've been working, but more to come. -- dfc\r\n",
